# Exercise 5: Advanced Git Workflow

## Steps Performed

1. Created multiple files in the repository to simulate a project.
2. Added a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files
3. Simulated “stash” by creating a new file `work_in_progress.txt` and not merging it yet.
4. Created a release tag for the project:
   - Tag: `v1.0`
   - Title: `First Release`
5. All files committed and pushed to main branch.
